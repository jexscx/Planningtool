## Installation

For this project i worked with [platformIO](https://platformio.org). This is a plugin for VS code. Here you have an UI to create, build and up0load your projects. It also registers used libraries and makes sure its all up-to-date.

When platformIO is used, you only have to upload the code to the arduino and you are all set! For further instructions go to [the client part](https://git.fhict.nl/I410676/kids-planning/-/tree/client) of this project.
